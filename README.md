# Portfolio Projects

## Haptik Text classification
Classification of Haptik user queries into appropriate Classes using NLP and ML techniques.
The goal of the project was to detect the user intent and classify the user chat into the following categories - food,recharge,support,reminders,travel,nearby,movies,casual and other.

A chat can be classified into multiple categories Ex. “Are there any offers going on?” This query could belong to all the domains in which transactions are possible ( travel, recharge, food, movies, home services, etc) Thus it was a Multiclass and multilabel problem.

Implemented a multi-label classifier using the training data. The classifier tagged all the possible domains (food, support etc) for each query using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random forest algorithms.
Achieved a label accuracy of 94% and subset accuracy of 74%

## Predicting survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset
[Link to the Titanic Survival project](https://github.com/gowthamdongari/Titanic_Survival)
The aim of this project was to get acquainted with the tools, learn about the different data structures (NumPy Arrays, Series and DataFrames) how they work and what they offer,and practice the key steps on the whole data analysis process.In this project I Explored the dataset containing information about Titanic passengers by using NumPy and Pandas, which are two popular Python packages used for manipulating datasets. 

I used Decision tree & Random forest algorithms to predict the percentage of passengers who survived.
I am currently at 1304th rank for the given competition on Kaggle with an accuracy score of 79.90%.
